## Dependencies

## Features

- Pick Up and Drop Off Containers at the Docks w/ the Dock Handler
- Optimised Code, running at 0.0ms at rest and peaking at 0.02ms when attaching a container

## Notes

- The Handler Natives only allow for the picking up and dropping of 'prop_contr_03b_ld', in future you'll be able to configure locations for these to spawn and *hopefully* allow for other containers to be picked up.

- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/DonHulieo/don-dockhandler/releases/tag/v1.0.2)
- Extract the don-dockhandler folder to your resources folder
- Add `ensure don-dockhandler` to your server.cfg
- Edit the config.lua to your liking
